# Hangman-Game
This is hangman game that's based on my favorite TV shows Adventure Time! Each "word" is a name of an Adventure Time character, ranging from main characters to minor characters.

+ Each time you guess a characters name the character will appear.
+ Press enter to start a new game.
+ If you fail to guess the character the game will restart automatically.
